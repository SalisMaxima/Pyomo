# About Pyomo
Pyomo is a Python-based open-source optimization modeling language. It allows you to express complex optimization problems in a simple and intuitive manner. With Pyomo, you can formulate, solve, and analyze optimization models efficiently.

# What You'll Find in This Repository
In this repository, you'll discover a collection of Jupyter notebooks, each tackling a specific optimization problem. These notebooks provide a step-by-step guide, including:

- Problem Description: A clear explanation of the optimization problem at hand.
- Model Formulation: How the problem is mathematically formulated as an optimization model.
- Pyomo Implementation: Code snippets demonstrating how to implement the model in Pyomo.
- Solution: How to solve the problem using optimization solvers like Gurobi or CBC.
- Visualization and Analysis: Visual representations of results and in-depth analysis of the solutions.
